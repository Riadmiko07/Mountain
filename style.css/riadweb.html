          <h2><span>About the mountain</span></h2>
          <p>
            Golija is one of the most beautiful, best preserved and most
            forested mountains in Serbia. It covers the territory of five
            municipalities: Ivanjica, Novi Pazar, Raska, Sjenica and Kraljevo.
            Surrounded by the mountains of southwestern and central Serbia,
            Golija dominates the landscape with its massiveness and occupies an
            area almost twice as large as the neighboring and much more famous
            Kopaonik.

        <h2>Golija ski resort</h2>
        <p>
          Due to its vastness, this mountain is perfect for a real, skiing adventure. Ski resort Odvraćenica is located at an impressive altitude of 1,744 m.
           You can only imagine how exciting and good the descent from such a height is. That is why this ski resort is becoming more and more popular and sought after.
            Odvracenica is surrounded by beautiful mountain peaks that make the whole mountain atmosphere even more beautiful and fairytale-like. 
            The whole ski resort is located in an extremely beautiful location and is well equipped with modern and contemporary equipment.
           Of course, the ski resort will only progress as the tourism of this region progresses.

        <h2>Mountain accommodation</h2>
        <p>
          Of course, mountain accommodation is especially popular, located in the heart of the mountain.
           Most of them are authentic log cabins that are built in a traditional, mountain style and are located in untouched nature. 
           In addition to these houses, it is believed that with the growth of tourism, many more similar facilities will be created, close to the ski resort. 
          Golija Mountain is still a largely untouched mountain, so the accommodation capacities on it are not fully developed.
           This mountain has yet to develop and use all its capacities and potentials.
